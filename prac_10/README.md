# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## Estimates

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

For smaller tasks, it was pretty close to the actual time, but for larger tasks, it tended to be more off.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

It stayed around the same.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

Sometimes I would go off face value for how long a certain project would take, rather than actually thinking about what
code would be involved.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I've only had 2 people do code reviews for me, and unfortunately, only one of them had provided meaningful feedback. So,
I don't have much of a meaningful comment on this question. The one person who did do a meaningful review did provide
some valuable tips that I had asked for regarding the readability of my code.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

There is almost always something that could be improved regarding someone's code.

### Good Code Review 1

[Practical 5 - dippro1](https://github.com/dipro1/cp1404practicals/pull/1)

### Explanation

I provided a comprehensive code review that included comments which ranged from simple spelling mistakes to pointing out
where a program was not functioning correctly.

### Good Code Review 2

[Practical 6 - Glen20White](https://github.com/Glen20White/cp1404practicals/pull/2#event-20816478689)

### Explanation

Although this person's practical 6 worked, I did find some parts of their program where the program could be improved.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I'm not sure. I found the practical tasks to be a great weekly activity. Maybe something to facilitate people to
genuinely do the code reviews, but I think I might have just got unlucky.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I tried to engage completely with all the practical material. Some weeks I did lose focus and was not able to especially
complete the extension and practice sections of the practicals, but I was always able to regain my focus in the
following week(s).
