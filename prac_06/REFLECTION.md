# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I started doing 100% of the practical work. Doing the practice extension tasks has helped me to assess how confident
I am with the week's content.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

Sometimes I don't practice in the Python terminal like Lindsay suggests. Specifically, I will watch the lecture videos 
and do the Do This Now tasks, without doing any further experimentation, e.g., practising in Python terminal or playing 
around in a Python sandbox file.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Attention to detail.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

Practice more.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Honestly, cannot think of anything at the moment. If I do think of something, then I will update this section in due
course.
